# Unified main integration

This document tracks implementation gates. It is not a statement that all gates
have passed. Work is isolated on `integration/unified-main`; existing worktrees
and `main` remain intact until the integration is reviewed.

## Acceptance gates

- [x] Preserve refs and uncommitted source work outside the integration worktree.
- [x] Fast-forward Codex and Factory server without duplicating their shared history.
- [x] Integrate Luna, multi-topology and Claude with targeted regression checks.
- [ ] Provide one validated TOML configuration and CLI; resolve defaults once and freeze the effective configuration per run.
- [x] Launch initial task hosts through one scheduler with a default 0.3-second interval.
- [ ] Isolate task runtime state, verify Codex initialization/authentication, and stage Slurm SQLite state on node-local storage.
- [ ] Preserve shared START, scoring, safe call-ID and stop semantics across native engines.
- [ ] Keep R14 as the Mosaic default; validate recommended physical candidates before publishing changed assets.
- [ ] Verify automatic pinned policy-asset installation from a fresh checkout.
- [ ] Verify old and compressed motion, image references, evidence restore and frozen-source Factory replay.
- [ ] Integrate qualified Oracle functionality without exposing private solutions to policies.
- [ ] Publish English-only current content, task atlas, editable full video project, detailed README and documentation.
- [ ] Exercise CPU, native macOS, NVIDIA/EGL and Slurm paths where hardware is available; record unavailable checks explicitly.
- [ ] Run offline suites and clean-checkout checks; record any remaining paid/hardware qualification separately.
- [ ] Review the integrated branch before publishing or merging it into main.

## Invariants

Task limits are measured from persisted START, normally 86,400 seconds. An
engineering stop is separate and must not silently replace the public task limit.
`ready` queries capability; it does not unlock START. Completion is evaluated by
an independent scorer; process events are reported separately. Dial completion
remains latched on unlock. Adaptive delegation remains optional and dynamic.

New requests receive host-generated IDs. Uncertain physical requests must not be
replayed under new IDs. Collection and archival run only after all writers stop;
source evidence is retained by default. Factory playback uses each recording's
frozen scene and assets, including legacy recordings. A successful restore or
render does not imply that the recorded task succeeded.

## Merge decisions

Luna's offscreen capture and capture timing are retained. Factory server's
array-based diagnostic Factory replay is retained, because it avoids requiring
production Cycles video rendering for pixel/FK comparisons. Luna's additional
call-ID query/uncertain-result tests are retained alongside Codex error tests.

## Initial regression inventory

The first full discovery run executed 1,272 tests in 118 seconds: 25 were
skipped, 179 errored, and one failed. This is a diagnostic inventory, not a
passing release gate. Most errors request historical scene/workstation assets
outside the current 36-case policy bundle. Other findings include missing Oracle
extras and script import paths, two synthetic robot fixtures missing their image
profile, a Factory fixture missing table metadata, and an outdated source
compatibility receipt. Do not update a provenance receipt merely to turn a test
green; verify the claimed equivalence first, or withdraw that claim.

The targeted engine/role/protocol checks are separate from this legacy inventory.
No live model calls were made by these checks. Claude's scored-run qualification
remains closed until its native lifecycle has passed the required real checks.

## Configuration and launch implementation

The first unified CLI stage is implemented in `robofrontier.cli`, with validated
`robofrontier.toml` settings and immutable per-run effective configuration.
`docs/unified-cli.md` documents actual supported options and pending interfaces.
The API path creates one home per task, serially initializes every home, then
launches hosts through one 0.3-second gate. Collection resolves per-task markers
while preserving legacy batch-home behavior. Native subscription refresh remains
an explicit qualification gap; credentials are never cloned automatically.

The native CLI wrapper can plan, bootstrap assets, prepare Codex runs or Claude
engineering drafts, explicitly preflight providers, run, read atomic status,
request stop, collect, ZIP, extract and restore evidence. Claude permanent-worker
modes and formal scored execution remain closed. Factory/Oracle/Slurm commands
have not yet been folded into this configuration schema.

Six real Codex 0.165.0 app-servers were initialized in independent cold homes and
then launched at a 0.3-second interval. All acknowledged initialization and exited
cleanly; no model turn or robot world was started. This verifies local startup,
not subscription refresh, 36-task resource capacity or provider execution. Raw
local evidence is under `runs/engineering/main-integration-codex-offline-20261101`.

The new command independently prepared four minimum-arm Level 1 cases with zero
model calls. All current 36-case asset hashes also passed inspection. The existing
asset lock is unchanged; recommended physics candidates still need final gates.

The source compatibility receipt was reviewed rather than blindly rehashed:
the exact observation-profile initialization and reported camera-size changes
are normalized alongside the service wrapper, and every remaining pipeline AST
node matches the original unaffected digest. The unaffected non-Relay evaluator
AST also matches its original digest. This establishes the limited historical
source claim, not equivalent policy observations, current scoring or new physics.

The completed configuration-stage regression group passed 123 tests. Thirteen
Codex host/transport Node tests also passed. Renderer checks reject a Mesa
software context when NVIDIA is requested and record the actual GL vendor,
renderer and version. The GPU validation still needs real Linux NVIDIA hardware.
The old synthetic ready-capability and Factory fixtures were brought up to date
without reducing their physics/FK assertions. Full historical-asset coverage,
Slurm staging, English migration and product UI/video gates remain outstanding.
